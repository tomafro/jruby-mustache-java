Very basic hack to get mustache.java working using jruby, for Dan Webb.

To run the code, with jruby run:

    jruby example.rb

There are two examples.  The first uses a java.io.StringWriter to collect the rendered template, while the second uses a ruby subclass of java.io.Writer, as a proof of concept showing such a thing is possible.
